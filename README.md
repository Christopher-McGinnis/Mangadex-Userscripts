# Mangadex-Userscripts
Userscripts for Mangadex.

Still trying to get a good dev environment going. Till then it will be difficult to update this.


#### Release locations:
* Libraries on github.
* UserScript on github and greasyfork

Gresyfork gets UserScript updates via Github webhook. Libraries will still point to github.

I will not be hosting the libraries on GreasyFork for the time being, since updating them requires publishing library, parsing site for the unique library version link (different from the \@version tag we control), and then updating the versions links in \@require. My UserScripts will still be hosted there for easy installation however.

Github way allows us to know the location before publication so long as we do 2 step commits (soon to be automated for me). Which is why I am using it for libraries.
